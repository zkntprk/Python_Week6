# Python_Week6

Create a class named `Triangle' and `Rectangle`.

Create a subclass named Square inherited from Rectangle.

Create a subclass named Cube inherited from Square.

Create a subclass named Pyramid multiple inherited both from Triangle and Square.

Two dimensional classes (Triangle, Rectangle and Square) should have:

- its dimensions as attributes.(can be inherited from a superclass)
- methods which calculate its area and perimeter separately. Three dimensional classes (Cube and Pyramid) should have:
- its dimensions as attributes which are inherited from a superclass
- its extra dimensions if there is. (hint: maybe for Pyramid)
- methods which calculate its volume and surface area separately. (surface area is optional, you may not do this)
